Nano Product Hazard and Exposure Assessment Tool
================================================

This model predicts an estimated exposure to materials of interest and superimpose this effective dose onto endpoint-specific dose-response curves for a variety of nanomaterials. This prediction base on the specific nanomaterial ambient concentration, matrix, potency factor, organism and endpoint.

This app is developed using `Shiny`, a web application framework `R`. You are welcomed to visit my app at http://yt210.shinyapps.io/NanoPHEAT and provide me feedback.
