Term,Definition Endpoint response,"""Endpoint response"" refers to any measured bioactivity in experiments designed to test the impacts of exposure to engineered nanomaterials."Nanomaterial content in product of interest,The user must enter the nanomaterial concentration in the product of interest.  This is the starting point to calculate the exposure potential to nanomaterials from the product.Matrix,"""Matrix"" refers to the physical state of the nanomaterial together in the consumer product type being evaluated for exposure potential.  The matrices considered here thus far include ""dispersive"", ""foam"" and ""plastic""."Dispersive matrix,Dispersive matrices refer to uses of the nanomaterial that include intentional dispersion in solutions (e.g. pesticide).Foam matrix,Foam matrices are sponge-like materials with nanomaterials incorporated during sponge fabrication.Plastic matrix,Plastic matrices are composites created with nanomaterials embedded (not coated).Potency Factor,"The ""Potency factor"" refers to the fraction of nanomaterials within a product matrix that are ultimately made ""available"" for interactions with the environment and biota. Recommended PFs were determined experimentally via release tests; the user may override these values to test various scenarios.  The PF times the ""Nanomaterial concentration in the product"" gives the applied dose for comparison with the model's dose response curves."Effective ENM Dose,"""Effective ENM Dose"" refers to fraction of ENM available for reactivity closely related to  matrix."Nominal ENM Dose,"""Nominal ENM Dose"" refers to dose of ENM in the system. If assuming PF is 1, then Nominal ENM Dose equals to Effective ENM Dose."Dose-Response Curves,"The dose response curves generated within this model represent aggregated literature data. The doses used to generate these curves are based on the experimentally designed doses applied in the studies, and do not represent the estimated ambient concentrations in various enviornmental compartments, nor do they account for cumulative loading from multiple sources.  They are experimental dose-response curves."Endpoint type,Shoot Length,Measured length of plant shootRoot Length,Measured length of plant rootO2�- Generation In Root Tissue,Generation of reactive oxygen species (O2�-) provides evidence that induced oxidative stress in root tissue that might lead to the cell death.H2O2 Generation In Root Tissue,Generation of reactive oxygen species (H2O2) provides evidence that induced oxidative stress in root tissue that might lead to the cell death.Mortality,The percentage of death of tested organisms.Cumulative Moulting,Moulting (shedding of carapace) frequency was calculated as percentage of the live organisms shedding their carapace.Body Length,Measured length of tested organism bodyWeight,Measured weight of tested organism bodyReproduction,"Reproduction is the biological process by which new ""offspring"" individual organisms are produced from their ""parents"". "Pupation Rate,"Pupation is the life stage of some insects undergoing transformation. The pupal stage is found only in holometabolous insects, those that undergo a complete metamorphosis, going through four life stages; embryo, larva, pupa and imago."Emergency Rate,"Insects emerge (eclose) from pupae by splitting the pupal case, and the whole process of pupation is controlled by the insect's hormones."Heart Rate @ 72 Hpf,Refers to heartbeats per minute at 72 hours post fertilizationHatching Rate,Refers to the successful emergence of young from an eggHeart Rate @ 24 Hpf,Refers to heartbeats per minute at 24 hours post fertilizationHeart Rate @ 48 Hpf,Refers to heartbeats per minute at 48 hours post fertilizationMitotic Index,a measure for the proliferation status of a cell populationMitochondrial Activity,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has devastating effects on the integrity of cells and may thus be critically involved in aging, metabolic and degenerative diseases, as well as cancer in higher organisms and humans"Seed Germination,Seed germination is the growth of an embryonic plant contained within a seed; it results in the formation of the seedling.Leaf Length,Measured length of tested leafShoot Mass,Measured weight of tested plant shootRoot Mass,Measured weight of tested plant root
